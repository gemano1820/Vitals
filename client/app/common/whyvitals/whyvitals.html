   <h2>Why Choose Vitals? </h2>
             <p> Because health isn’t an industry. It’s a cause.</p>
             <p> Vitals was founded on the radically simple idea that everyone deserves the chance to live a healthy life. 
                 That’s why you can find high-quality care and coverage in one place.
             </p>
             
        <h2>Smarter.. More Personalized Care </h2>
            <p>When all your care-givers are connected on the same electronic health record system, 
               they know when you’re due for a screening. Or if you’re allergic to a medication. 
               And they can work together to help keep you healthier — staying focused on getting you the right care, 
               instead of more care. It’s good to have some team support.
            </p>
        
        <h2> Real value for you and your family </h2>
            <p> Nothing is more important than your health and the health of your loved ones. 
                So when you pay for health care, you want your money to be used wisely.
                As a Vitals member, you get more than just a plan that fits your budget. 
                You get coverage that goes where life takes you — whether you’re rock-climbing every weekend or relaxing in retirement. 
                And you get a team approach to care that can help keep you from getting sick in the first place.
            </p>
